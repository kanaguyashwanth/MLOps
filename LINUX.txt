LINUX: Working with FIles and Directories

File System Tree 
Absolute Path 
Relative Path

-Listing Files and Directories:
	- ls    	  -> Lists files and directories
	- ls -a 	  -> Lists all pseudo hidden files and directories
	- ls -l /var/log/ -> Long listing format (Shows permissions for files and directories)
	- ls -al	  -> Shows pseudohidden and in listing format(Perms for files and directories)
	- ls -h		  -> Shows the human readable sizes of the files
	- ls -alh	  -> Shows human readable sizes(h), perms(l), hidden files and directories(a)

	- File System Tree:
		- Root is at top and the branches and leaves grow downward.
		- root - /
		- Under root
	
	- Absolute vs. Relative Paths
	
	NAVIGATION:
	- pwd 		  -> print work directory
	- cd		  -> change directory
	- ../		  -> go one directory up
	- cd /		  -> takes to the root directory
	- ../../	  -> takes to the actual directory
	
	CREATION:
	- touch		  -> create a new file [touch Reciept.pdf] 		--->	pwd: /home/aaron ---> creates a file: /home/aaron/Reciept.pdf
			ABSOLUTE PATH	       [touch /home/jane/Receipt.pdf] 	--->	pwd: /home/aaron ---> creates a file: /home/jane/Reciept.pdf
			RELATIVE PATH	       [touch ../jane/Reciept.pdf]	---> 	pwd: /home/aaron ---> creates a file: /home/jane/Reciept.pdf
	- mkdir		  -> make directory

	COPY:
	- cp [source] [dest]    -> copies the files to another folder		 [cp Receipt.pdf Receiepts/]	---> 	pwd: /home/aaron/Reciept.pdf	---> copies the file: /home/aaron/Receipts/Receipt.pdf
	- cp -r [source] [dest] -> copies all the files/folder to another folder [cp -r Receipts/ BackupOfReceipts/]		

	MOVE: (No Recursive for this unlike COPY)
	- mv [source] [dest]    -> moves the file from one directory to another [mv Receipt.pdf Receipts/]
									     [mv Receipts/ OldReceipts/]

	REMOVE:
 	- rm Invoices.pdf   -> removes the file
	- rm -r Invoices/   -> removes all the files and directories under it
